        <h2 class="row-title">LOGO</h2>

                <img src="gallery-resources/logos/logo1.png">
                <p class="gallery-item-description">I designed it to do more than just represent a brand, it embodies energy, heat, and hype. By shaping the brand’s name into flames, I fused identity with impact, symbolizing the fire behind every product. Bold, dynamic, and unforgettable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="gallery-resources/logos/logo2.jpg">
                <p class="gallery-item-description">With the task of modernizing their logo while preserving the pride and legacy of their brand, I crafted a design that is minimalistic yet bold, ensuring it remains impactful and timeless. The signature arrows and distinct green color were retained, symbolizing their direction and identity. Additionally, I incorporated elements representing their UAE branch, subtly integrating the nation’s flag colors to honor their roots.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="gallery-resources/logos/logo3.png">
                <p class="gallery-item-description">Rotary Apparel Co. wanted a logo that embodied their global reach and the essence of 'rotary' all while staying true to their street-style identity. I designed a globe-inspired logo, with their brand name wrapping around it, symbolizing movement and worldwide influence. To infuse the raw energy of street fashion, I incorporated spray drip effects, adding a bold, urban edge that reflects contemporary streetwear culture. The result? A logo that spins with attitude, authenticity, and global appeal.</p>

                <p class="gallery-item-description">Even though it is just a concept art, I took this project seriously. Creating an extra-terrestrial beverage taking some inspiration and references for the text styles like from the movie "Back to the Future".</p>

            <div class="gallery-item poster-item">
                <img src="gallery-resources/posters/poster2.png">
                <p class="gallery-item-description">Purely created with Adobe Illustrator, I managed to meet my client's satisfaction and exceed his expectations. The client has no available actual product at that time so I had to improvise and created a 3D model of a bottle just using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
